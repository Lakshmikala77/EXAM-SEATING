# EXAM_SEATING_Arrangement_System
In an Institute, specifying the classroom with seat position is the work carried out during exams conducted by the university. Most of the work carried out through office software and printouts attached on the surroundings of the institute boards. The process of arranging students into the available classrooms is a tedious process. In this process, one or more anomalies occurred as if student can able to reflect in one or more classrooms or it cannot allotted at all. This can happen when number of students and number of classrooms are more.

The proposed system can able to simplify the work of exam section by implementing feasible normalization techniques during sections arrangement and also generate effective reports for seating arrangement in addition to this ,the student can made an enquiry about its allotted room using the portal instead of verifying the notice board of the exam section.
